# CNN_MarsSurfaceFeatures

The European Space Agency (ESA) has unveiled remarkable images of a fossilized river system on Mars, stretching nearly 700 kilometers. The uncanny resemblance to Earth's terrain has inspired us to delve deeper into understanding Mars' surface features.

This project is dedicated to training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using the ESA's Mars river system image. We aim to leverage the power of CNNs to extract valuable insights from this intriguing Martian landscape.

## CNN Operations
In our exploration, we'll apply several crucial CNN operations, including:

- Convolution Layer: To analyze local patterns and features within the image.
- Activation Layer: For introducing non-linearity and enhancing feature extraction.
- Pooling Layer: To reduce dimensionality and focus on important information.

## Example Code
To get started, we've provided example code on [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-convolution-neural-network/) that demonstrates how to apply CNN operations to extract features from the Martian image.
